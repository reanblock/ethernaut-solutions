## Ethernaut Solutions

These are Foundry Forge Script solutions for all current Ethernaut challenges.

2. Run `forge build`
3. Open the script you want to run. For example, start with [Fallback.s.sol](./script/Fallback.s.sol).
4. Read the instaructions in the script comments section which explain how to run the script.
5. To run the scripts as you play Ethernaut you will need to update the instance address as you proceed.
